# Design Notes

Alerts plus aims to completely replace the default alerts system in Factorio. With more features and improved usability, this mod will blow it out of the water! Hopefully.

## Features

- Alerts history
    - Ability to scroll through past alerts and view their details, and re-summon them to the map
- Persistent alerts
    - A different section of the GUI, perhaps?
